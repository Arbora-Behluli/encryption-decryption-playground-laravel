# Encryption / Decryption Playground

An interactive **Laravel-based playground** designed for experimenting with
encryption and decryption algorithms in a simple, educational environment.

This project was developed as part of my **Bachelor Thesis** and focuses on
helping users understand how encryption mechanisms work through hands-on
interaction.

---

# Purpose

The goal of this playground is to:
- Demonstrate how encryption and decryption algorithms operate
- Allow users to input custom data and observe transformations
- Provide a clear and accessible learning tool for students and developers
- Users can see the time and memory these algorithms take

No authentication or database is required — users can directly interact with
the algorithms via the interface.

# Features

- Encryption of user-provided input
- Decryption of encrypted values
- Real-time processing
- Algorithm-focused (no unnecessary complexity)
- Clean UI for educational clarity
